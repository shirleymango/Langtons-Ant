# Langtons-Ant
Langton's Ant Simulation

The rule of Langton’s Ant is very simple: the ant is placed onto the board that is filled with white spaces, and starts moving forward. For each step forward, the Langton’s ant will follow 2 rules:
1. If the ant is on a white space, turn right 90 degrees and change the space to black.
2. If the ant is on a black space, turn left 90 degrees and change the space to white.
After that, the ant moves to the next step and continues moving forward. The ant will follow these rules, and continue moving around the board, until the number of steps runs out.


Bonus features: User can choose the ant's name, the ant's initial orientation, and the step size for printing the board. The user can also choose to add a third color onto the board.
